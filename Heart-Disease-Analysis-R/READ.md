# Heart disease analysis - Multi-linear regression problem.

## Introduction : 
   __You are a public health researcher interested in social factors that influence heart disease. 
   You survey 500 towns and gather data on the percentage of people in each town who smoke, the percentage of people in each town who bike to work, 
and the percentage of people in each town who have heart disease.
Because you have two independent variables and one dependent variable, and all your variables are quantitative, you can use multiple linear regression 
to analyze the relationship between them.__
